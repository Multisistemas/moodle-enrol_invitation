# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #
#   If your instance is under a mod_alias Alias, then you must
#   correctly set the following variable to 
#   /<Alias URL-path>/course
#   
#   i.e.
#       if your instance is under the alias:
#   
#           Alias "/foo" "/bar"
#       
#       then the following line should look like this:
#
#           RewriteBase /foo/course
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #
RewriteBase /course

# expand pretty view/shortname to a proper parameter
# 
#   NOTE: Comment one of the two following statments:
#
# Use this one if this file is in the /course directory
RewriteRule ^view/(.+)$ view.php?name=$1 [NC,NE,QSA,PT]
# Use this one if this file is the root of moodle
#RewriteRule ^(.*)/course/view/(.+) $1/course/view.php?name=$2 [NC,NE,QSA,L]

# Some 3rd party blocks use "../" relative paths to refer to the Moodle root 
# folder.
# This breaks in our scheme since /course/view/../blocks/ will transform 
# into /course/blocks/, instead of just /blocks/, as expected by the block.
# To avoid this, every folder except format, import & report will be considered 
# to be in the root.

# Aggressive, but makes sure relative hyperlinks with "../" don't break.

# Will have to be updated if /course/ folder gets additional subfolders in 
# future Moodle versions

# Store the relative URL we are working with. Strange, but RewriteCond doesn't 
# have it!?
RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NE,E=REL_PATH:$0]

# check if it contains "/" and is NOT one of the existing course/* folders
RewriteCond %{ENV:REL_PATH} /
RewriteCond %{ENV:REL_PATH} !^format/ [NC]
RewriteCond %{ENV:REL_PATH} !^import/ [NC]
RewriteCond %{ENV:REL_PATH} !^report/ [NC]
