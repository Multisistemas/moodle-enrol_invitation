This is a filter for using MathJax in Moodle 2.x sites. For information on how
to actually use MathJax, please look to http://mathjax.org for insight as I cannot
provide assistance with the construction of equations in TeX or MathML.

Some notes on usage:

  * You might want to disable the TeX filter if you're using this filter in a course. The
    two filters use the same delimiting sequences and you may notice interference between
    them.
  * Enabling the MathJax filter will cause the MathJax components to be invoked on all pages
    below the level at which it is activated regardless of whether any MathJax sequences are
    actually used in the page.
    For example, if you enable the filter for a specific course, it will be active on all
    pages of that course but not for any other courses in the Moodle site. If you enable it
    at the system level, all courses and all pages in your Moodle site will include the
    MathJax components.
    My suggestion is to set up the filter as "Off, but available" at the site level and
    then turn it 'On' in courses where you want to use it.
