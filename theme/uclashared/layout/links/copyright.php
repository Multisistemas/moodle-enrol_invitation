<h2 class="footer-page-header">Distributing Copyrighted Materials through CCLE</h2>
<p class="footer-page-text">All materials distributed through the CCLE system must be in compliance with <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Title 17</a> of the US Code, generally known as the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">1976 Copyright Law</a>.</p>
<p class="footer-page-text">Every reproduction of a copyrighted work (which includes the act of uploading materials to CCLE) should be done in compliance with this law, and it is the user's responsibility to determine compliance.  The instructor of record is responsible for all materials uploaded by teaching assistants, staff, or others doing so at the instructor's request.</p>
