<p>Enabling public/private functionality for a course alters several settings in order to create a hybrid course with both public and private material.</p>
<p>When enabled, it will create a toggle for all activities that allow for the material to be set either private to course users or public to guests as well. To this end, it creates a special group and grouping. It disables the auto-assign groups and available to guest settings.</p>';
