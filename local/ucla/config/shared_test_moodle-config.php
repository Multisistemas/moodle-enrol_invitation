 *  This configuration file has been preconfigured to set certain variables
 *  such that launching and upgrades will run as smoothly as possible.
 *
 *  Currently, the plan is to symbolically link this file as such:
 *  moodle/config.php -> moodle/local/ucla/config/<this file>
 *
 *  The original configuration file should not be used, as it does not have
 *  any capability of saying that another configuration file can be 
 *  included before starting the Moodle session.
 *
 *  If you want configurations to be not within revisioning, then place
 *  your secrets @ moodle/config_private.php.
